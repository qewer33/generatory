Generatory is a unique tool for game developers and designers to create generative assets. Generatory includes many cool and useful "generators" to create all kinds of different images from grids and patterns to wallpapers. Each generator has it's own set of parameters that can be changed to get different results. The parameters can also be randomized with the "Randomize" button to get a random result.
